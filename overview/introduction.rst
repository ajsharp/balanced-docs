Overview

.. container:: overview-large

  Balanced is a payments company dedicated to increasing the world's 
  economic output. To do this, we've decided to work with online 
  marketplaces and crowdfunding platforms to help them create new forms of commerce.
  We’ve built a white-labeled API and open sourced dashboard to help them 
  do this. And while we really like working with marketplaces and 
  crowdfunding platforms, Balanced can be used for e-commerce models of all types.

  We’ve been processing live transactions since October, 2010 and have a
  history of working closely with our customers to solve their problems,
  specifically those related to multi-party transactions. For example,
  we’re in an `open partnership`_ with `Gittip`_ after volunteering code
  and expertise to help them `mitigate the risks of running a
  marketplace`_. To date, Balanced has contributed to Gittip’s `payments
  infrastructure`_, `visual design`_, and `fraud preventions systems`_.

  Balanced believes in openness and transparency, so, despite being a
  payments company, we try to discuss as much of our product development
  decisions in public as possible. We’ve even `discussed pricing
  decisions`_ publicly with our customers.
